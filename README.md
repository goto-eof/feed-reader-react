# Feed reader | React

Some days ago I needed to integrate my (blog)[http://dodu.it] posts on my other (website)[http://andre-i.eu]. Both domains points to the same host. I could access to the database by implementing a server for andre-i.eu and retrieve what I needed for the website, but I opted for a quick solution: my blog generates a feed xml. I needed to implement a feed reader in React and play with CORS origin. 
Therefore I pushed this component, perhaps could be usefull also for you.

# Run it
```
yarn start
```
